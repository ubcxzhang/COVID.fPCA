# COVID.fPCA

In this project, we apply Functional Principal Component Analysis to COVID-19 infection trajactories of 3000+ US counties. We then analyze the association between the FPC scores and the demographic charateristics of the counties along with the implement of lockdowns.

Our goal is to identify important characteristics that affect shape of infection trajactories. These characteristics can be used to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.
